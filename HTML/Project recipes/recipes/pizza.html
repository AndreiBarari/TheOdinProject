    <p>Delicious and easy to make home made pizza for you and your family.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>1 envelope of yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Toppings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces of sausage</li>
        <li>1 cup of frozen hash brown potatoes</li>
        <li>a quarter cup of chopped onions</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>half a teaspoon of mustard</li>
        <li>half a teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 cup of shreded chedar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast and salt in a large bowl. Heat water and oil until very warm (120
            degrees to 130 degrees F). Add to flour mixture and beat for 2 minutes. Add enough remaining flour to make a
            soft dough. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest at
            this point for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Roll dough to 12-inch circle; place in greased pizza pan. OR, pat dough with floured hands, pressing
            gently to fill greased pizza pan or baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough; prick
            surface with fork.</li>
        <li>Bake crust in preheated 450 degrees F oven on lowest oven rack for 8 minutes. Reduce oven to 375 degrees
            F. Remove pizza from oven.</li>
        <li>Top pizza crust with sausage, hash browns and onions. Beat eggs, ground mustard, pepper and salt
            together in a bowl. Pour over toppings. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 16 to 20 minutes until eggs are
            set and crust is browned.</li>
    </ol>
